# nes-auth-blog

![nes-auth-blog showcase](server/assets/img/nes-catalog-showcase.gif "nes-auth-blog showcase")

A static blog with fun Nintendo-themed user authentication built with [Hexo](https://hexo.io/), [Koa](https://github.com/koajs/koa), and [NESS.css](https://github.com/nostalgic-css/NES.css). It is generated and powered by Node.js.

### About

nes-auth-blog uses Hexo with a customized [aath](https://github.com/lewis-geek/hexo-theme-Aath) theme to render your markdown files into a static blog. It then runs a lightning-fast Koa server with static user authentication to serve the blog.

It is intended as a private, simple, lightweight, and zero-configuration blog for sharing internal or personal documentation across a small group of people via Markdown - beloved by developers the world over - as the preferred writing medium.

It leverages the use of Git for keeping track of changes in authorship of blog posts and publications, and for easy deployment. 

### Setup

1. Clone the repo.
2. Create, edit, and place your markdown `.md` files (blog posts) in the `source/_posts` directory.
3. Add your authorized users to the array in the `server/users.json` file as a `{ "name": "user", "password": "pword" }` object.

### Running

To run an instance of nes-auth-blog simply run the `npm install` and `npm start` commands in the root of the repository directory and open a browser window to `http://localhost:3000/`.

The default credentials to access the blog are username `admin` and password `root`. **Please remember to remove the default credentials before deploying to secure your blog**.

### Configuration

To configure your blog title and other information, open and [edit](https://hexo.io/docs/configuration) your `_config.yml` file.

For more Hexo-specific configuration please refer to the Hexo [documentation](https://hexo.io/docs/).

You can configure two environment variables at deployment time or at development time with [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv):
* `SESSION_SECRET` - the key used to encrypt and store the session cookie on the client-side
* `PORT` - the port number for the server

You are encouraged to make this project your own by customizing the server authentication styles under `server` with a framework like [PSone.css](https://github.com/98mprice/PSone.css) and with a [different](https://hexo.io/themes/) Hexo theme.
